			Apart from several policy measures, one of the \textit{"soft measures"} would be to develope a more comprehensive and reliable benchmarking and standard tools to improve building energy performance. Some of these guildlines or benchmark standards are National Australia Building Environment Rating Standard (NA BERS), Australia's Green Star, European Union Passive House, UK's Building Research Establishment Environment Assessment Method (BREEAM), Swiss Minergie, US's Leadership in ENergy and Environmental Design (LEED) and Energy Star \cite{ZOU2018165}. However, these benchmark standards rely heavily on predicted building comfort and energy consumption, while the actual energy consumption is usually far from the calculated values \cite{tuohy2015closing}. As there are many designers use standard benchmark calculation tool as their design basis, developing a more reliable calculation method would be a good approach to improve the problem.
